# UC Berkely Pacman

Project for 'Artificial Intelligence' university course

## Project 1 - Search 
Project 1 consists of search problems inside the Pacman world, in which Pacman needs to find a path from the starting point to the target.
The following exercises were implemented during project 1: 
1. Find the path to target using Depth-First Search
2. Find the path to target using Breadth-First Search
3. Find the optimal path (with food) using  Uniform-Cost Search
4. Imrove search with A*
5. Create new problem in which the goal is to pass through all corners
6. Implement a Heuristic to get the smallest path through all corners
7. Implement a Heuristic to eat all food
8. Greedy search for nearest food

## Project 2 - Multiagent
The goal of project 2 is to create an agent that can successfully beat a game of pacman with opponent agents (ghosts) 
The exercises were: 
1. Create an agent with Minimax algorithm
2. Improve Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruing
3. Create an agent with Expectimax
4. Improve the state evaluation function
